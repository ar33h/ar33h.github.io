      I'm currently a Graduate Student at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.pace.edu/seidenberg/" target="_blank">Seidenberg School of Computer Science & Information Systems</a>, Pace University majoring in Cyber Security.

      I am adept at designing and developing products. My goal is to always build applications that are efficient under the hood while providing a secure user experience.
